# Faust√£o Text Generator

A Vanilla JS text generator of the iconic brazilian showman. I made this project to fun and to test my knowledge in Javascript.

I got inspired to make this project after see the <a href="https://github.com/diegofelipece/mussum-ipsum/" target="_blank">Mussum Ipsum</a> and <a href="https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/" target="_blank">App Ideas Collection</a>

### Prerequisites

To work correctly this project need the <a href="https://github.com/tapio/live-server" target="_blank">Live Server</a>. <br />

Install using **NPM**:
```bash 
$ npm install -g live-server
```
Open command line in project's directory and run:
```bash
$ live-server
```
If prefer, like me, you can install Live Server extension in your VSCode and run more easily.<br />
